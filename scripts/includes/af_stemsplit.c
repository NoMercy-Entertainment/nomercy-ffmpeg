/*
 * stemsplit: separate music into vocal and accompaniment stems using the
 * Deezer Spleeter 2stems network, run on ggml (the same library statically
 * linked into this binary for the whisper filter, via whisper.pc).
 *
 * The filter negotiates 44.1 kHz stereo planar float, loads and validates the
 * model's 100 GGUF tensors (ss_model_load), builds the two U-Nets into a
 * single ggml graph once (ss_graph_build) and reuses it for every segment.
 * The segment driver (ss_push_samples / ss_process_segment) runs a 4096-point
 * STFT at hop 1024, hands each 512-frame segment's magnitude to the networks,
 * turns their estimated magnitudes into ratio masks (ss_build_masks), extends
 * those masks over the band the network does not model (`highband`), applies
 * them to the ORIGINAL complex mixture spectrum -- the mixture's phase is
 * reused unchanged -- and resynthesises one stem per output pad.
 *
 * Input of any sample rate and any channel count is accepted. 44.1 kHz stereo
 * -- the rate and layout the network was trained at -- runs through untouched;
 * anything else is resampled to it on the way in and back to the input's own
 * rate and layout on the way out (ss_rs_*), so a 24-bit 96 kHz file comes back
 * out 24-bit and 96 kHz instead of silently becoming a 44.1 kHz one.
 *
 * `debug_input` remains an internal parity hook: it injects a spectrogram
 * straight from disk, runs the networks on it once and dumps every layer tap
 * for the per-layer comparison of design section 9.2. It bypasses the audio
 * driver entirely.

/* ---- Kernel repacking: GGUF axis order -> ggml's convolution axis order --
 *
 * gguf-py writes a tensor's numpy shape *reversed* into the file, so
 * convert.py's (kw, kh, ic, oc) array arrives here as ne = [oc, ic, kh, kw]:
 * ggml's ne[0], the fastest-varying axis, is the numpy array's *last* axis.
 * ggml's convolution ops want the exact opposite, ne = [kw, kh, ic, oc], kw
 * fastest. Probed against the pinned whisper.cpp 1.9.1 ggml before this was
 * written: a kernel with ne = [KW, KH, IC, OC] convolved against data with
 * ne = [W, H, IC, N] reproduces a hand-computed reference exactly.
 * (ggml.h's "// a: [OC, IC, KH, KW]" comments say the same thing written in
 * reversed, numpy-style order -- they are not a second convention.)
 *
 * The correction is a full reversal of all four axes. It is done once, here,
 * rather than per graph build, and it is applied uniformly to every kernel --
 * conv*, up* and out -- because it corrects the container's axis convention,
 * not any one layer's use of it. Leaving up* and out in the on-disk order would
 * hand the decoder a half-converted model. After the reversal:
 *
 *   conv*.weight  [oc,ic,kh,kw] -> [kw,kh,ic,oc]   ggml_conv_2d_direct wants
 *                                                  ne[2]=IC, ne[3]=OC
 *   up*.weight    [ic,oc,kh,kw] -> [kw,kh,oc,ic]   ggml_conv_transpose_2d_p0
 *                                                  wants ne[2]=OC, ne[3]=IC
 *   out.weight    [2,1,4,4]     -> [4,4,1,2]       the output conv, same
 *                                                  [KW,KH,IC,OC] convention
 *
 * conv_weight() in tools/spleeter-gguf/convert.py already swaps TensorFlow's
 * kh/kw before writing, which is what makes the plain reversal land kh and kw
 * the right way round here; the two halves only make sense together.
 *
 * The tensor is rewritten in place. That is deliberate and it is why
 * ss_resolve_tensor()'s shape validation runs first, against the on-disk
 * order: the loader's contract is with the file, this is the adaptation layer
 * that sits after it. Nothing else reads these tensors in between.

 *
 *     output_sum = sum_j (S_j ^ p) + EPSILON
 *     mask_i     = (S_i ^ p + EPSILON / N) / output_sum
 *
 * EPSILON appears TWICE with different scaling -- whole in the denominator,
 * divided by N in the numerator. That is upstream Spleeter's formula, not a
 * typo, and it is what makes the masks sum to exactly 1 when every estimate is
 * zero (silence) instead of 0/0. Do not "simplify" the two terms into one.
 *
 * p is the `exponent` option and defaults to 2, the released 2stems
 * configuration. p == 2 is special-cased to a multiply, so the default path
 * costs no powf() and stays bit-identical to what this computed before the
 * option existed. Lowering p softens the split -- more of the other stem
 * bleeds through, fewer masking artifacts -- and raising it hardens it.
 *
 * Above bin SS_F (11 025 Hz) the network predicts nothing at all, so the mask
 * there is a policy decision rather than a computation -- design section 7.
 *
 * `smooth` and `bleed` are both LINEAR in the per-instrument masks and apply
 * the same coefficients to all of them, so the masks still sum to exactly 1
 * afterwards and the stems still sum back to the mixture. That is not a
 * nicety: it is the property tests/check_stems.py asserts, and it is why they
 * are a box filter and a blend toward uniform rather than a clamp followed by
 * a renormalisation, which would not have it.
 *
 * The `highband` switch is the one place that can break the sum, and exactly
 * one of its modes does: SS_HB_ZEROS sets every instrument's mask to 0 above
 * SS_F, so above 11.025 kHz they sum to 0 rather than 1 and the stems are
 * short of the mixture by whatever it had up there. That is the mode's whole
 * purpose -- it is upstream Spleeter's behaviour, kept for A/B -- so the test
 * checks that mode's identity below the edge instead of dropping it.

 *
 * Analysis slides a 4096-sample window over the input in 1024-sample hops.
 * The window starts all-zero and the first frame is analysed before any real
 * sample arrives: that zero window IS step 1's 4096-sample lead-in, and
 * crop_remaining discards the matching 4096 output samples in step 9. Framing
 * a signal that has 4096 zeros glued to its front is exactly what a zeroed
 * sliding window does, so the lead-in costs one frame, not a copy of the
 * whole waveform.
 *
 * Frame spectra go into a ring of exactly SS_T slots. Segment k covers global
 * frames [k*hop, k*hop + SS_T) -- the whole ring -- and retires frames
 * [k*hop, (k+1)*hop), whose slots are precisely the ones segment k+1's new
 * frames overwrite. So the ring is never short and never has to grow.
 *
 * A retired frame's mask multiplies the ORIGINAL COMPLEX mixture spectrum
 * stored in that ring slot (step 7): the mixture's phase is reused unchanged
 * and never reconstructed.

 * identically and fed identical sample counts, so they stay in lockstep, and
 * ss_emit_samples asserts that rather than assuming it.
