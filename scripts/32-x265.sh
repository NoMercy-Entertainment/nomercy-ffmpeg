# x265 is built three times (12-, 10- and 8-bit) and the three archives are
# merged into one libx265.a. None of that used to be checked: not one cmake,
# make or mv exit status, and the single check at the end only caught a merge
# that produced no file at all.
#
# CI run 30399011649 (freebsd-x86_64) installed a libx265.a without the 10/12-bit
# halves and reported x265 as built successfully. The failure surfaced ~25
# minutes later as ffmpeg's
#   ERROR: x265 not found using pkg-config
# which points at pkg-config rather than at x265; the real cause was further
# down its log, "undefined symbol: x265_10bit::x265_api_get_*". The same job had
# passed hours earlier with this script and x265 pinned at Release_4.1, and the
# trigger has not been reproduced.
#
# So the checks below are deliberately about the artifact rather than about any
# one suspected cause: every step reports its own failure, and the merged and
# installed archives are proven to contain all three halves. Note that member
# counts alone are not enough -- three 8-bit archives merge to a perfectly
# plausible 3x74 members -- hence the symbol check.
