# Restores alpha-channel decoding for HEVC-with-alpha video produced by Apple
# VideoToolbox (iPhone/iPad recordings, Keynote/Motion exports, HEVC stickers).
#
# Such files carry ONE hvc1 track holding a two-layer HEVC bitstream:
#   nuh_layer_id = 0 -> colour, nuh_layer_id = 1 -> alpha
# declared through a VPS extension with scalability_mask = AUXILIARY, AuxId = 1.
#
# Early VideoToolbox writes a non-standard VPS extension. Stock 8.1.2 failed to
# parse it, fell back to nb_layers = 1, logged "Ignoring unsupported VPS
# extension" and silently dropped the alpha layer -- decoding to an opaque
# yuv420p frame, with alphaextract failing on "Requested planes not available."
#
# Three patches are applied, all needed for the alpha layer to come out right:
#
#   1. hevc-alpha-videotoolbox.patch     upstream eedf8f0165fe (2026-04-01)
#      Keeps the alpha layer instead of discarding the broken VPS extension.
#      SHIPS IN 9.0 -- step 1 detects the marker and skips.
#
#   2. decode-get-format-first-sw.patch  upstream 3befae81f1dc (2026-03-27)
#      avcodec_default_get_format() picks the FIRST software format instead of
#      the last, so the alpha format the hevc decoder offers first actually
#      wins. Without this, ffprobe and every libavcodec API consumer still
#      decode the base layer only; ffmpeg CLI was unaffected because it
#      installs its own front-to-back get_format callback.
#      SHIPS IN 9.0 -- step 3 detects the marker and skips.
#
#   3. hevc-alpha-stream-pixfmt.patch    NoMercy-only, optional
#      Reports yuva420p at stream level. Probing never decodes a slice, so
#      without this ffprobe -show_streams shows the base-layer yuv420p while
#      the frames decode as yuva420p. Delete the file to drop this one.
#      STILL REQUIRED on 9.0 -- upstream export_stream_params() is unchanged.
#
# Both upstream commits landed on master after release/8.1 branched and were
# never backported, so no 8.1.x point release carries them. FFmpeg 9.0 does.
# The patch files are kept so this script still works against 8.1.x; each step
# is marker-guarded, so applying them on 9.0 is a no-op rather than a conflict.
#
# See: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7965

# Lives in /scripts/includes (tracked) rather than /scripts/patches, which is
# gitignored wholesale for the AACS keydb and so never reaches CI.

# Second upstream patch, required for the alpha layer to be decoded at all by
# anything using libavcodec's default get_format callback. The hevc decoder
# offers the alpha format first and the base-layer format last; stock 8.1.2's
# avcodec_default_get_format() returned the LAST software entry, so it always
# landed on the base layer. ffmpeg CLI installs its own front-to-back callback,
# which is why the CLI produced alpha while ffprobe did not. Fixed upstream in
# 9.0; the guard below skips this step there.
