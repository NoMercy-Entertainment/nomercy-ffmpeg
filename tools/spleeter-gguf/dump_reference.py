"""Rebuild Spleeter's 2stems U-Net in Keras and dump per-layer reference
activations for a fixed synthetic input, so Tasks 7/8's ggml graph has
something to be checked against.

Produces:
  - `fixtures.json` (committed): 26 entries (`<inst>.<layer>`), each with
    shape, summary statistics and 64 fixed sample points.
  - `<raw-dir>/<inst>.<layer>.f32` (not committed): full activations, one
    file per layer, `[C][T][F]` byte order (F fastest) -- ggml's native
    memory layout for `ne = [F, T, C, 1]`.
  - `<raw-dir>/../fixtures_input.f32` (not committed) -- **interface
    contract, not just a byproduct**: the fixed input magnitude
    spectrogram every fixture in `fixtures.json` was computed from.
    Path: the parent directory of `--raw-dir` (`os.path.dirname` of it),
    filename `fixtures_input.f32`. Shape `[C=2][T=512][F=1024]` float32,
    same `[C][T][F]` byte order as the layer dumps above (F fastest). A
    later task injects this file as the network's input directly,
    bypassing the STFT (a planned `debug_input=<path>` filter option),
    so per-layer parity tests the network in isolation -- feeding real
    `anoisesrc` audio through the STFT instead produces a different
    spectrogram and cannot be compared against these fixtures.

Encoder taps: `conv1..conv6` are each the RAW, pre-BatchNorm,
pre-activation Conv2D output -- for every one of the six, not only
`conv6`. Every skip connection in the real graph concatenates the raw
conv (`merge1 = [conv5, drop1]` ... `merge5 = [conv1, batch11]`), never
the activated tensor (`rel1`..`rel5`) that feeds the next encoder stage.
A ggml implementation must keep each encoder layer's pre-BN tensor alive
and expose it separately from the BN+LeakyReLU'd tensor used internally
to compute the next stage -- getting this backwards is a real
separation-quality bug in the shipped filter, not just a fixture
mismatch. See `build_unet()` below for the full derivation, including
the conv6 bottleneck's extra wrinkle (its BN/activation are pure dead
code, computed but never consumed anywhere).

Precision: conv kernels are loaded F16-rounded (`load_weights()` does
`kernel.astype(np.float16).astype(np.float32)` before handing them to
Keras). This is deliberate, not a bug -- convert.py ships `.weight`
tensors as F16 (`conv_weight()`, `verify_dtypes()`), so the
runtime never sees full-precision kernels. A fixture computed from
unrounded F32 kernels describes a different, more precise network than
the one that actually ships, and F16's ~1e-3 rounding error alone can
exceed compare.py's default rtol -- large enough to fail a bit-correct
ggml implementation for a reason that has nothing to do with its
correctness. **This coupling is load-bearing: if the artifact's
precision ever changes (e.g. a future F32 or Q8 GGUF), these fixtures
must be regenerated to match, or the parity test again measures a
precision difference instead of a correctness one.** Biases and
BatchNorm's affine terms stay F32 throughout, matching the shipped
artifact (convert.py's EXPECTED / verify_dtypes()).

Usage:
    python dump_reference.py --checkpoint /work/2stems \
        --fixtures /out/fixtures.json --raw-dir /out/ref

    Encoder block: Conv2D(5,5,stride2,same) -> BatchNorm -> LeakyReLU(0.2).
    Decoder block: Conv2DTranspose(5,5,stride2,same) -> ReLU -> BatchNorm
    -> concat(skip, x). Dropout(0.5) sits between BatchNorm and concat on
    up1-up3 in the source; it is a no-op at inference (training=False) and
    is omitted here rather than modelled as an identity layer.

    Skip connections use the RAW conv output, every time, not just at the
    bottleneck. Upstream:
        merge1 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv5, drop1])
        merge2 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv4, drop2])
        merge3 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv3, drop3])
        merge4 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv2, batch10])
        merge5 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv1, batch11])
    Every one of these concatenates `conv1..conv5` -- the pre-BatchNorm,
    pre-activation Conv2D output -- never `rel1..rel5` (the BN+LeakyReLU'd
    tensor that feeds the *next* encoder stage). So each encoder layer has
    two distinct consumers reading two distinct tensors: `rel_n` feeds
    `conv_{n+1}` going down the encoder, and the separate raw `conv_n`
    feeds the matching decoder block's concat coming back up. `taps["conv1"
    .."conv6"]` below are therefore all the raw tensor -- this is a general
    rule across every encoder layer, verified against the literal source
    above, not an assumption or a conv6-only special case.

    The conv6 bottleneck applies the same rule one step further, plus an
    extra wrinkle: upstream computes
        conv6 = Conv2D(...)(rel5)
        batch6 = BatchNormalization(...)(conv6)
        _ = conv_activation_layer(batch6)          # <- discarded
        up1 = Conv2DTranspose(...)((conv6))         # <- fed from conv6, RAW
    batch6 and the LeakyReLU that would follow it are computed (so the
    checkpoint carries trained gamma/beta/moving_mean/moving_variance for
    it) but their output is never used anywhere -- not as a skip source
    like conv1..conv5's raw tensors, not as anything. `taps["conv6"]` is
    the same raw tensor as conv1..conv5's taps; it just also happens to be
    conv6's *only* consumer, since there is no `rel6` feeding a seventh
    encoder stage. Getting either the general rule or this extra wrinkle
    backwards would make the corresponding downstream fixture(s) wrong.

    Returns (masked_output, taps) where taps maps the 13 layer ids this
