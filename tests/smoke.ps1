# executed here at all. For those platforms we never execute — we validate the
# PE header (MZ/PE signatures + Machine field) instead, which also catches a
# mislabeled or truncated artifact. Native platforms are always executed, so a
# broken native binary can never slip through.

# ggml CPU variant dispatcher: two checks, in order.
#
# 1. The binary must actually carry the dispatcher. This is what makes the
#    check below able to fail at all: a binary that never reads
#    NOMERCY_GGML_CPU "starts cleanly" with it set to anything, trivially, so
#    a check built only on process exit codes can never distinguish a
#    dispatcher-enabled build from an old one that predates this feature --
#    it would always pass, manufacturing confidence rather than catching a
#    regression. Test-CpuVariantDispatcherPresent searches the binary for the
#    literal env-var name instead (see its comment in lib/cpu-variant.ps1 for
#    why that's reliable even stripped, and the empirical before/after
#    counts). Skipped on darwin: it legitimately never contains that string
#    (darwin never reaches this script today, but the shape mirrors smoke.sh
#    in case that changes).
#
# 2. NOMERCY_GGML_CPU must never stop the binary from starting, unset, forced
#    to the platform baseline (old hardware keeps working), or forced to
#    garbage (a bad override can't brick a machine). Needs no model, so
#    unlike tests/tests.ps1's fuller, model-gated check (run manually, on
#    real hardware, with a real model) this runs on every CI build.
