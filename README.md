**Internal Build Tool for NoMercy MediaServer**

*High-performance, cross-platform FFmpeg binaries optimized for media processing*

</div>

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository contains the build infrastructure for creating optimized FFmpeg binaries (currently **FFmpeg 9.0**) specifically tailored for the **NoMercy MediaServer** ecosystem. These builds include custom filters, muxers, codecs, and optimizations that enhance media processing capabilities within our platform.

> **⚠️ Internal Use Only**
> These FFmpeg builds are specifically configured for NoMercy MediaServer and may not be suitable for general-purpose use. For standard FFmpeg binaries, please visit the [official FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/).

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our build system uses a modular Docker-based approach: a shared base image ([ffmpeg-base.dockerfile](ffmpeg-base.dockerfile)) provides the toolchains, and per-platform dockerfiles run the numbered build steps in [scripts/](scripts/) — one script per dependency or custom patch — before compiling FFmpeg itself.

### Supported Platforms
| Platform | Architectures | Built in CI |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Linux** | x86_64, aarch64 (ARM64) | ✅ |
| **Windows** | x86_64 | ✅ |
| **macOS** | x86_64, Apple Silicon (ARM64) | ✅ |
| **FreeBSD** | x86_64 | ✅ |
| **Windows** | ARM64 (aarch64) | ✅ ⚠️ see below |

Each release ships `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `ffplay` (where built) as fully static binaries per platform.

### Windows on ARM (windows-aarch64)

Built and released like every other platform, with one difference that matters:
**no automated test ever executes it.**

It uses a different toolchain from the rest — llvm-mingw (clang/lld) rather than
GCC, because the GCC cross-compiler for this target crashes on
`-fstack-protector-strong` and ships a CRT header that does not parse.

Nothing in CI can run an ARM64 Windows binary. `windows-latest` is x64, and
Windows-on-ARM emulates x64 rather than the reverse, so `tests/smoke.ps1`
downgrades to validating the PE header (`Machine == 0xAA64`) instead of
executing — the same treatment `smoke.sh` gives `linux-aarch64` and
`freebsd-x86_64`. That proves the artifact is a well-formed ARM64 binary
carrying the expected symbols. It does not prove it decodes a single frame.

There is also no Windows-on-ARM machine in the verify fleet, so `verify-rc.yml`
produces no verdict for it and `sync-checklist.js` leaves its checklist box
unticked. **A release PR therefore stays blocked until a human runs
`tests/tests.ps1` on real hardware and records a verdict.** That is deliberate:
the box is the only thing standing between an unexecuted binary and a release.

When running it by hand, pass the platform explicitly:

```powershell
.\tests\tests.ps1 -Workspace <extracted-dir> -Platform windows-aarch64
```

`-Platform` defaults to `windows-x86_64`, so omitting it produces a verdict
labelled for the wrong platform — which `sync-checklist.js` will then match
against the wrong checklist box.

To close the gap, add a runner labelled
`["self-hosted","ffmpeg-verify","windows-aarch64"]`, then add the matrix entry
in `.github/workflows/verify-rc.yml` and the name in the `REQUIRED` list in
`.github/workflows/fleet-health.yml`. Both carry comments pointing back here.

Meanwhile Windows-on-ARM users are not stranded: the `windows-x86_64` build runs
under Windows' x64 emulation. The native build is a performance improvement.

Capability differences from `windows-x86_64`, all deliberate:

| Component | windows-x86_64 | windows-aarch64 | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| NVENC / CUDA / AMF / QSV | ✅ | ➖ | No NVIDIA, AMD or Intel GPU exists on Windows-on-ARM |
| OpenBLAS (whisper) | ✅ | ➖ | Builds x86 kernels regardless of `TARGET`; whisper falls back to ggml's own kernels, as on linux/darwin/freebsd |
| SVT-AV1 dotprod/i8mm | n/a | ➖ | Optional aarch64 extension kernels; baseline NEON is on. Enabling them would raise the hardware floor for every WoA device |
| Everything else | ✅ | ✅ | x264, x265, AV1, VPx, opus, xavs2, zimg, Vulkan, and all NoMercy filters/muxers |

### Build Features
- 🔒 **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability assessment on all platform images
- 🧪 **Automated Testing**: Per-platform smoke tests; cross-arch artifacts are validated via ELF header inspection
- 📦 **Artifact Management**: Version-stamped archives with SHA-256 sidecars and a GPG-signed `manifest.json`
- 🔄 **Smart Builds**: Change detection rebuilds only the platforms affected by a commit
- 🚦 **RC Pipeline**: Every master build publishes a Release Candidate prerelease before promotion to a final release

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions workflows provide a complete automation pipeline ([main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml)):

### Workflow Components
- **Change Detection** ([detect-changes.yml](.github/workflows/detect-changes.yml)): Single source of truth for the platform list; only builds what's changed
- **Reusable Docker Builds** ([reusable-docker-build.yml](.github/workflows/reusable-docker-build.yml)): Parallel compilation on self-hosted runners
- **Smoke Testing**: Binaries are executed on matching GitHub-hosted runners; non-native architectures get archive and ELF-header validation
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy scans with SARIF upload to GitHub code scanning (master builds)
- **Release Management**: RC prereleases on every master build, promoted to versioned final releases with per-asset `.sha256` sidecars, `manifest.json`, and a detached GPG signature (`manifest.json.sig`)
- **PR Guards** ([pr-guards.yml](.github/workflows/pr-guards.yml)): Gate checks on pull requests
- **npm Publish** ([npm-publish.yml](.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml)): Publishes the [`@nomercy-entertainment/ffmpeg-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nomercy-entertainment/ffmpeg-static) client when a release is created

## 📋 Configuration & Features

### ✨ **Enhanced Features vs Official FFmpeg**

Our custom FFmpeg builds include several features **NOT** available in official FFmpeg releases:

#### 🎯 **NoMercy-Exclusive Components** (patched into the FFmpeg source tree)
| Component | Type | What it does |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **`keydetect`** | Audio filter | Musical key and chord detection |
| **`beatdetect`** | Audio filter | Tempo, beat grid and confidence as `lavfi.beatdetect.*` frame metadata; octave decided from the onsets, not from a preferred range |
| **`stemsplit`** | Audio filter | Music source separation into vocal and accompaniment stems (Spleeter 2stems on ggml) |
| **OCR subtitle encoder** | Codec | Converts bitmap subtitles (DVD/Blu-ray) to WebVTT text using Tesseract OCR |
| **Sprite-sheet muxer** | Muxer | Generates thumbnail sprite sheets with a WebVTT timeline for player scrubbing |
| **Chapter VTT muxer** | Muxer | Exports chapter metadata as WebVTT |
| **VOBsub muxer** | Muxer | Writes DVD-style VOBsub subtitle output |
| **OmniDrive protocol** | Protocol | Direct I/O against NoMercy OmniDrive storage (Linux/Windows/FreeBSD) |
| **`dvdread:` protocol** | Protocol | `dvdread://` URI input (byte-stream over libdvdread title VOBs, symmetric with `bluray://`) |
| **Auto-create directories** | Core patch | Output muxers automatically create missing parent directories |
| **HEVC alpha layer** | Decoder patch | Decodes the alpha channel of HEVC-with-alpha video from Apple VideoToolbox (single `hvc1` track, two-layer bitstream) instead of silently dropping it. Backports upstream `eedf8f0165fe` + `3befae81f1dc`, neither of which reached 8.1.x, plus a NoMercy change so `ffprobe` reports `yuva420p` at stream level and not just per frame ([ticket #7965](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/7965)) |
| **`whisper` language detection** | Filter patch | The `whisper` filter exposes the auto-detected spoken language (`lavfi.whisper.language` + `lavfi.whisper.language_confidence` frame metadata, `detected_language` object in JSON output) |
| **AACS/BD+ static keydb** | Patch | libaacs/libbluray patched for built-in Blu-ray decryption support |

#### 🎤 **`stemsplit` — Music Source Separation**

Separates a music track into `vocals` and `accompaniment` stems using the
Deezer Spleeter `2stems` U-Net, run on **ggml** — the same runtime already
statically linked into every platform binary for the `whisper` filter, so
`stemsplit` adds no new dependency and no growth of the shipped tarball.

```bash
# Karaoke: instrumental only, plain -af
ffmpeg -i song.flac -af "stemsplit=model=2stems.gguf:stem=accompaniment" karaoke.flac

# Both stems, one filtergraph with two outputs
ffmpeg -i song.flac -filter_complex \
  "[0:a]stemsplit=model=2stems.gguf:stem=all[v][a]" \
  -map "[v]" vocals.flac -map "[a]" music.flac
```

`stemsplit` emits one 1024-sample frame per STFT hop, so its output is
encoder-friendly everywhere — including formats with a block-size ceiling,
such as FLAC's 65,535 samples. No rechunking filter is needed.

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | *required* | Path to the `.gguf` model file |
| `stem` | enum | `all` | `vocals`, `accompaniment`, or `all` (one output pad per stem) |
| `highband` | enum | `extend` | How to handle the band above 11 025 Hz, which the network does not see. `extend` carries each stem's own mask at the top of the modelled band upward, crossfaded in; `passthrough` routes the untouched high band into the last stem; `zeros` reproduces upstream Spleeter bit-for-bit; `average` tiles each frame's mean mask across the band |
| `exponent` | float | `2` | Separation exponent. 2 is the released Spleeter configuration; lower is a softer split, higher a harder one |
| `bleed` | float | `0` | Smallest share of the mixture every stem keeps in any bin. Fills the deepest spectral holes; it is **not** a cure for ducking |
| `smooth` | int | `0` | Smooth the masks over this many frequency bins either side |
| `overlap` | duration | `0` | Crossfade between segments (e.g. `5`, `1.5`, `00:00:05.000`); `0` matches reference Spleeter's un-overlapped chunking |
| `threads` | int | `0` | ggml CPU threads; `0` uses the filter's default |

**Why `extend` is the default.** `passthrough` was, until it was measured. It
loses nothing, but it hands *all* the unmodelled energy to one stem
unconditionally — and just under the edge the vocal network has usually claimed
nearly everything, so the accompaniment's spectrum steps *up* as it crosses
11 025 Hz. On a piano-and-voice ballad that step measures **+14.0 dB**; a bright
band with nothing underneath it, over a body that ducks whenever the singer
sings, is what gets reported as a whistle and a fader. Under `extend` the same
measurement is **−0.4 dB**.

The vocal stem gains more than the accompaniment does: under every other mode
it is hard-cut at 11 kHz, so its sibilance and breath are simply absent.
`extend` puts about **38 dB** of 11–14 kHz and **51 dB** of 14–18 kHz back into
it, while changing nothing inside the modelled band.

**Any rate, any channel count, in and out.** The network is a 44.1 kHz stereo
model, so anything else is converted to that on the way in and back to the
input's own rate and layout on the way out — a 24-bit 96 kHz file produces
24-bit 96 kHz stems. 44.1 kHz two-channel audio takes neither conversion and
runs the path unchanged. Two consequences worth knowing: a hi-res file keeps
its rate but not its top octave, because the separation happened at 44.1 kHz;
and more than two channels is folded to stereo for the network and upmixed
back, which the filter logs as a warning.

**Model:** `spleeter-2stems-f16.gguf` (39,319,552 bytes) is published as a
GitHub release asset on this repository, downloaded the same way whisper's
ggml models are — not bundled in the platform tarballs. *At the time of
writing this asset has not yet been attached to a release; the download
link will resolve once it is published.*

**This is an offline filter, by design.** The network needs a full ~512-frame
(~11.9 s) segment before it can emit anything, so `stemsplit` is unsuitable
for live playback — that lookahead is what the architecture requires, not an
oversight. Throughput on 16 threads of a modern desktop CPU is roughly
**1.8x realtime** for the `2stems` pair (about 0.11x realtime per core,
since ggml's own kernels — not a BLAS gemm — drive the convolutions here):
a four-minute track takes a little over two minutes to separate on such a
machine. Peak resident memory is about **194 MiB** for `stem=all`, rising
somewhat with `overlap` set non-zero. This makes it a good fit for a
media server pre-generating karaoke tracks on library scan, not for
real-time use.

**What's verified and what isn't.** The network's output is checked
layer-by-layer against a Python reference (26 of 26 layers across both
instrument networks, `rtol=1e-3`) — that is what establishes the ggml graph
faithfully reproduces Spleeter's published weights. Separately, summing the
two output stems reconstructs the original mixture to about -138 dB, but
that figure validates only the STFT/overlap-add signal path: the ratio masks
sum to 1 by construction, so the same result holds even if the network's
output were garbage — a deliberate mask-swap mutation still measured
-138.2 dB. **No human has listened to the separated output yet**; treat
separation quality as unverified until that listening pass happens.

### ⚠️ **Limitations vs Official FFmpeg**

While our builds are feature-rich, some official FFmpeg characteristics differ **intentionally**:

| Aspect | Our Choice | Impact |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Shared Libraries** | Static linking only | ⚪ Larger binaries, zero dependency issues |
| **Debug Symbols** | Stripped for production | ⚪ Smaller binary size |
| **Licensing** | GPL + version3 + nonfree | ⚪ Not redistributable as LGPL; internal use |

## 🔐 Security & Integrity

Security is paramount in our build process:

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: All platform Docker images are scanned with Trivy; results upload to GitHub code scanning
- **Release Integrity**: Every release asset ships a `.sha256` sidecar; `manifest.json` lists all assets with SHA-256 digests and sizes, and `manifest.json.sig` is a detached ASCII-armored GPG signature over the manifest
- **macOS Signing**: Darwin binaries are code-signed with rcodesign (mandatory for ARM64 on macOS 11+)
- **Dependency Management**: Pinned dependency versions with a documented update process ([UPDATE.md](UPDATE.md))

## 📦 Distribution & Integration

### GitHub Releases
Version-stamped archives per platform (`ffmpeg-<version>-<platform>.tar.gz` / `.zip` for Windows), published first as an RC prerelease and then promoted to a final release.

### npm Package
[`@nomercy-entertainment/ffmpeg-static`](clients/npm/README.md) fetches the matching binary for the current platform on first use:

```ts
import { ensureFfmpeg, ensureFfprobe } from '@nomercy-entertainment/ffmpeg-static';

const ffmpeg = await ensureFfmpeg(); // absolute path, downloaded on first call
```

It also installs `nomercy-ffmpeg-path` / `nomercy-ffprobe-path` CLI bins for non-JS tooling.

### NoMercy MediaServer
1. **Automated Updates**: New releases trigger MediaServer updates
2. **Version Pinning**: Specific FFmpeg versions are tested and validated
3. **Manifest Verification**: MediaServer verifies asset digests against the signed `manifest.json`
4. **Configuration Sync**: Build options aligned with MediaServer requirements

## 📄 License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details. Note that the compiled FFmpeg binaries themselves are built with `--enable-gpl --enable-nonfree` and are intended for internal use.
