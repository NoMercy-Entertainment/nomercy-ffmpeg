# Design: `stemsplit` — Spleeter music source separation as an FFmpeg audio filter

**Date:** 2026-08-19
**Branch:** `feat/spleeter-filter`
**Status:** Approved design, pending implementation plan

---

## 1. Summary

Add a native FFmpeg audio filter, `stemsplit`, that separates a music track into
`vocals` and `accompaniment` stems using the Deezer Spleeter `2stems` model.

The filter runs the network on **ggml**, which is already statically linked into
every one of this repo's seven platform binaries by way of `whisper.cpp`. No new
third-party dependency is introduced. The deliverable is one filter source file,
one build script, one offline model-conversion tool, and a dev harness.

---

## 2. Goals

- `2stems` separation (vocals / accompaniment) at 44.1 kHz stereo.
- Works on all seven build targets: linux x86_64/aarch64, windows x86_64/aarch64,
  darwin x86_64/arm64, freebsd x86_64.
- No new dependency in the static link; no growth of the shipped tarball.
- Output quality at least equal to upstream Spleeter, with an opt-out improvement
  to its band-limiting artifact.
- Numerically verifiable against the Python reference, layer by layer.

## 3. Non-goals

Explicitly **not** in this work, though none are precluded later:

- 4-stem and 5-stem models.
- GPU backends (CUDA / Metal / Vulkan).
- Real-time or low-latency operation. The algorithm requires ~11.9 s of lookahead.
- Multichannel Wiener filtering (Spleeter's optional `norbert` path). The released
  models are tuned for ratio masking, which is Spleeter's default.
- A generic multi-architecture model loader. The GGUF carries an architecture tag
  so a second architecture *can* be added later, but only one is implemented.
- Bundling model weights in the platform tarballs.

---

## 4. Background: the reference algorithm

All constants below are taken from `deezer/spleeter` at `master` and from
`spleeter/resources/2stems.json`. They are reproduced here because the
implementation must match them exactly.

### 4.1 Signal parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| `sample_rate` | 44100 |
| `n_channels` | 2 (stereo) |
| `frame_length` | 4096 |
| `frame_step` | 1024 |
| window | Hann, **periodic** |
| `T` (frames per segment) | 512 (approx. 11.888 s) |
| `F` (bins fed to network) | 1024 (0 to 11 025 Hz) |
| full bins in STFT | 2049 (`frame_length / 2 + 1`) |
| `separation_exponent` | 2 |
| `EPSILON` | 1e-10 |
| `WINDOW_COMPENSATION_FACTOR` | 2/3 |

### 4.2 Forward pipeline

1. Prepend **`frame_length` (4096) zeros** to the waveform, per channel.
2. STFT with the parameters above and `pad_end=True` (the tail is zero-padded so
   every sample is covered). Result is indexed `[time, bin, channel]`.
3. Zero-pad the time axis to a multiple of `T`, partition into `T`-frame segments,
   and keep the **first `F` bins** of the magnitude. Network input per segment is
   `[T=512, F=1024, C=2]`, raw magnitude with no normalisation.
4. Run one U-Net **per instrument**. Each emits a sigmoid mask which is multiplied
   by the network input to yield that instrument's estimated magnitude `S_i`.

   **Two distinct tensors, easily conflated.** The network's final layer — the one
   named `out`, dumped for parity and recorded in `fixtures.json` — is the
   **sigmoid mask itself**, before the multiply. Its values lie in [0, 1]. The
   **estimated magnitude** `S_i = out * input` is a separate quantity, and it is
   `S_i` that feeds the ratio-mask formula in step 5. Both are correct and both
   exist in the implementation; only the shared name invites confusion. This is
   also why the layer count is 13 per network rather than 14.
5. Build ratio masks across instruments:

   ```
   output_sum = sum_j (S_j ^ 2) + EPSILON
   mask_i     = (S_i ^ 2 + EPSILON / N) / output_sum
   ```

6. Extend each mask from `F` bins to 2049 bins (section 7).
7. Multiply the **original complex mixture STFT** by the extended mask. The
   mixture's phase is reused unchanged.
8. Inverse STFT by weighted overlap-add — the Hann window is applied a second time
   on synthesis — and scale by `WINDOW_COMPENSATION_FACTOR` (2/3). For Hann
   periodic at 75 % overlap the analysis-synthesis window power sums to 1.5, so
   2/3 is the exact reconstruction gain.
9. Crop the result to `[frame_length, frame_length + original_length)`.

### 4.3 Network architecture (per instrument)

Encoder — six blocks, each `Conv2D 5x5 stride 2 SAME` then `BatchNorm` then
`LeakyReLU(0.2)`. **Each block has two distinct outputs — see section 4.3.1,
which corrects this table.**

| Layer | Out channels | Out shape (T x F) |
|---|---|---|
| input | 2 | 512 x 1024 |
| conv1 | 16 | 256 x 512 |
| conv2 | 32 | 128 x 256 |
| conv3 | 64 | 64 x 128 |
| conv4 | 128 | 32 x 64 |
| conv5 | 256 | 16 x 32 |
| conv6 | 512 | 8 x 16 |

Decoder — six blocks, each `Conv2DTranspose 5x5 stride 2 SAME` then `ReLU` then
`BatchNorm` then `Dropout(0.5)` then concat with the matching encoder output:

| Layer | Out channels | Out shape | Concatenated with | Channels into next |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| up1 | 256 | 16 x 32 | conv5 | 512 |
| up2 | 128 | 32 x 64 | conv4 | 256 |
| up3 | 64 | 64 x 128 | conv3 | 128 |
| up4 | 32 | 128 x 256 | conv2 | 64 |
| up5 | 16 | 256 x 512 | conv1 | 32 |
| up6 | 1 | 512 x 1024 | — | 1 |

Output — `Conv2D 2ch, 4x4, dilation 2, SAME, sigmoid`, then multiplied elementwise
by the network input.

Approximately **9.82 M parameters per instrument**, about 20 MB at fp16. The
`2stems` configuration is two such networks, about **39 MB**.

### 4.3.1 Corrections to 4.3, from reading the real graph (2026-08-19)

The tables above describe the architecture as it is usually summarised. Reading
`spleeter/model/functions/unet.py` directly, during Task 3, turned up three
places where the real graph differs. The released weights were trained with the
real graph, so **these are not defects to fix — they are behaviour to reproduce.**
All three were verified against upstream source, quoted below.

**(a) Every skip connection uses the RAW convolution output, not the activated one.**

```python
merge1 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv5, drop1])
merge2 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv4, drop2])
merge3 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv3, drop3])
merge4 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv2, batch10])
merge5 = Concatenate(axis=-1)([conv1, batch11])
```

The decoder concatenates `conv1..conv5` — the pre-BatchNorm, pre-activation
tensors — never `rel1..rel5`. So each encoder block produces **two** outputs
that both matter:

| Output | Definition | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| raw `conv_n` | `Conv2D(...)` result plus bias | the skip concatenation into `up_{6-n}` |
| `rel_n` | `LeakyReLU(0.2)(BatchNorm(conv_n))` | the next encoder block |

An implementation whose encoder block returns only the activated tensor cannot
wire the skips correctly. This is a correctness bug in separation quality, not
merely a failing test.

**(b) The sixth encoder block's BatchNorm and activation are dead code.**

```python
conv6  = conv2d_factory(conv_n_filters[5], (5, 5))(rel5)
batch6 = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(conv6)
_      = conv_activation_layer(batch6)          # result discarded
up1    = conv2d_transpose_factory(conv_n_filters[4], (5, 5))((conv6))
```

`up1` consumes raw `conv6`. `batch6` and its activation are computed and thrown
away. The `conv6` BatchNorm parameters still exist in the checkpoint and are
still exported to the GGUF — keeping them preserves the 100-tensor count and the
uniform tensor naming — but the runtime must **never apply them**.

**(c) Dropout is applied to only three of the six decoder blocks.**

`merge1..merge3` concatenate `drop1..drop3`, while `merge4` and `merge5`
concatenate `batch10` and `batch11` directly, with no Dropout layer between.
This has no effect on inference, where Dropout is identity in every case, and is
recorded only so the next reader of this document does not "fix" the asymmetry.

**Note on activation ordering.** The encoder is `conv -> BN -> activation`, so its
BatchNorm folds backward into the convolution. The **decoder is
`convT -> activation -> BN`**, so its BatchNorm sits *after* a nonlinearity and
cannot fold backward. Rather than fold some layers and not others, the converter
reduces **every** BatchNorm to a per-channel affine `y = a*x + b` and the runtime
applies it as an explicit op. Cost is negligible; uniformity removes a whole class
of conversion bugs. Dropout is identity at inference and is dropped entirely.

### 4.4 Compute and memory budget

About 6.1 GMAC per 11.9 s segment per instrument, roughly **1 GFLOP per second of
audio per stem**.

**Measured, superseding this document's original estimate.** A full forward pass
costs about **3.3 s per instrument per 11.888 s segment** on 16 threads of an
i7-10700K, so the `2stems` pair runs at roughly **1.8x realtime wall-clock** —
about **0.11x realtime per core**.

The original text here claimed 5-20x realtime per core, derived from the MAC count
on the assumption of a BLAS-backed gemm running near peak. That assumption does
not hold: the graph uses `ggml_conv_2d_direct` (see 6.3.1), which is
not gemm-optimised, and the F16 im2col path it replaced was not faster — it was
11% slower and used 5 MiB more. The estimate was wrong by roughly two orders of
magnitude per core and is corrected here rather than left to mislead.

This remains acceptable for the stated use case and does not change the design:
section 3 scopes this filter to offline processing, and a four-minute track
separates in a little over two minutes on a 16-thread machine — fine for a media
server pre-generating karaoke tracks on library scan, and unsuitable for
real-time playback, exactly as already documented.

Peak resident memory, measured on the complete filter: **194 MiB**, rising to
about **211 MiB** when `overlap` is non-zero. The estimated budget was 200 MB, so
the default configuration sits just inside it and the overlap path just outside.
Neither figure is a problem for the target deployment, but the estimate should no
longer be quoted as a ceiling.

### 4.5 What the reconstruction test does and does not prove

Summing the stems reconstructs the mixture to about **-138 dB**. This is a strong
result for the signal path and a worthless one for separation quality, and the
distinction matters enough to record.

The ratio masks sum to exactly 1 by construction in the `passthrough` and
`average` high-band modes, and the normalised overlap blend preserves that sum
exactly. So the figure validates the periodic Hann on both ends, the 2/3
compensation, overlap-add alignment, the ring index arithmetic, reuse of the
stored complex spectrum, the 4096-sample lead-in crop, and the EOF truncation.

It does **not** validate that the network ran, that the estimated magnitudes are
what they claim to be, that the two masks are not swapped, or that the separation
is any good. A build with garbage in the magnitude estimates reconstructs to the
same -138 dB. A deliberate mask-swap mutation was measured at -138.2 dB.

Separation correctness rests on the per-layer parity of section 9.2, which
compares both instruments' final sigmoid against the Python reference. Separation
*quality* rests on listening, which no measurement here substitutes for.

## 5. Approach

### 5.1 Inference runtime — decision

| Option | New dependency | Static across 7 targets | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ggml (already linked)** | none | yes | **chosen** |
| FFmpeg DNN framework via libtorch / OpenVINO / libtensorflow | ~2 GB | no | rejected |
| ONNX Runtime | large | no (freebsd, windows-aarch64) | rejected |
| Hand-written SIMD C | none | yes | rejected — re-implements ggml's per-arch gemm |

`scripts/48-whisper.sh` writes a `whisper.pc` exporting
`-lggml -lggml-base -lggml-cpu` (plus `-lggml-blas` on darwin and windows-x86_64).
The filter therefore declares `stemsplit_filter_deps="whisper"`. This is honest
about where libggml comes from and degrades gracefully — if whisper is ever
disabled, the filter is simply absent rather than breaking the build.

Upstream precedent supports this: FFmpeg's own `af_whisper` bypasses the DNN
framework and links whisper.cpp directly. FFmpeg's DNN filters are all video-only;
there is no audio DNN filter upstream and no source-separation filter of any kind.

### 5.2 Model choice — why Spleeter and not Demucs

Demucs v4 separates audibly better, but its **pretrained weights are CC-BY-NC 4.0**,
which rules them out for a commercial product. Spleeter's weights ship from an
MIT-licensed repository. That licensing gap is the deciding factor. The filter
therefore takes the model as a `model=` path rather than hardcoding it, so a
better permissively-licensed model later is a file swap, not a rewrite.

---

## 6. Components

Four units, each separately testable.

```
tools/spleeter-gguf/            offline, Dockerised, never shipped
    TF checkpoint -> per-channel BN affine -> fp16 GGUF -> GitHub release asset
                            |
                            v
scripts/includes/af_stemsplit.c
    segmenter -> STFT (av_tx) -> ggml U-Net x2 -> mask -> ISTFT/OLA -> outputs
                            |
scripts/60-stemsplit.sh     v         dev/ffstem-vol
    allfilters.c + Makefile + configure    fast rebuild harness
```

### 6.1 Unit 1 — model converter (`tools/spleeter-gguf/`)

A throwaway Docker image. TensorFlow is needed only to read the checkpoint; the
`spleeter` package itself is not required, since `tf.train.load_checkpoint`
suffices.

Responsibilities:

- Read the `2stems` checkpoint.
- Reduce each BatchNorm to per-channel `(a, b)` where
  `a = gamma / sqrt(var + eps)` and `b = beta - mean * a`.
- Transpose weights from TensorFlow's `[kh, kw, in, out]` (and
  `[kh, kw, out, in]` for transposed convolutions) to ggml's expected layout.
- Emit fp16 tensors into a GGUF file carrying metadata: architecture tag,
  version, sample rate, frame length, frame step, `T`, `F`,
  `separation_exponent`, and the ordered instrument list.
- **Also emit reference activations** for one fixed 11.9 s input segment — every
  one of the 13 layers per network — as the parity fixture for section 9.2.

Output artifact: `spleeter-2stems-f16.gguf`, about 39 MB, published as a GitHub
release asset. It is never committed to git and never bundled in the platform
tarballs.

### 6.2 Unit 2 — the filter (`scripts/includes/af_stemsplit.c`)

Follows the structure of `scripts/includes/af_whisper.c`: an `activate()`-driven
filter with an internal ring buffer.

- **Format negotiation** pins `AV_SAMPLE_FMT_FLTP`, stereo, 44 100 Hz. FFmpeg
  auto-inserts `aresample`, so arbitrary input still works.
- **Segmenter** accumulates 512 STFT frames (524 288 samples) plus the 4096-sample
  lead-in, emits a segment, and retains overlap state. At EOF the tail is
  zero-padded to a full segment and the output cropped back to the true length.
- **STFT / ISTFT** use `av_tx` (`libavutil/tx.h`) real-to-complex of size 4096 with
  a precomputed periodic Hann window, hop 1024, and 2/3 synthesis gain.
- **Inference** runs the ggml graph twice per segment, once per instrument.
- **Mask, extension, application** exactly as section 4.2 steps 5 to 7.
- **Output** is written to one or two output pads (section 8).

### 6.3 Unit 3 — the ggml graph

Built once at `init()` and reused; weights loaded from GGUF into a `ggml_context`,
allocation via `ggml_gallocr`, threads from `ff_filter_get_nb_threads()`.

The one genuinely delicate part is **TensorFlow `SAME` padding**, which for kernel
5 / stride 2 pads **1 before and 2 after** — asymmetric. `ggml_conv_2d` offers only
symmetric padding and `ggml_conv_transpose_2d_p0` offers none, so each layer type
is emulated explicitly:

| Layer | Emulation | Size check |
|---|---|---|
| `Conv2D 5x5 s2 SAME` | copy into a zeroed tensor padded 1 before / 2 after on both axes, then convolve with `p=0` | `(N+3-5)/2 + 1 = N/2` ok |
| `Conv2DTranspose 5x5 s2 SAME` | `ggml_conv_transpose_2d_p0` yields `2N+3`; **crop 1 from the front and 2 from the back** | `2N` ok |
| `Conv2D 4x4 dilation 2 SAME` | effective kernel 7, total pad 6, so symmetric `p=3`, native | `N` ok |

Symmetric padding is **not** an acceptable shortcut: with `p=2` the output shape
happens to come out right, but every window is shifted one input sample, which
produces plausible-sounding but incorrect audio. This is the same failure class as
the latent FFT-stride bug in `af_beatdetect.c`, and it is why section 9.2 exists.

Two ggml details to confirm during implementation, each with a stated fallback:

- `ggml_conv_2d` historically requires **F16 kernels** on the im2col path. If the
  pinned whisper.cpp exposes `ggml_conv_2d_direct` with F32 kernels, use it;
  otherwise keep weights F16, which is the intended format anyway.
- The GGUF reader (`gguf.h`) must be present in whisper.cpp's installed headers.
  If it is not installed, fall back to a small custom flat container — magic,
  version, tensor table — as `demucs.cpp` does. This decision is made in the first
  implementation step, before any other work depends on it.

#### 6.3.1 ggml capability probe results (probed 2026-08-19)

Both unknowns were settled against the pinned whisper.cpp 1.9.1 ggml, using a
throwaway Docker harness (`ffstem-vol:latest`, built from a scratchpad
Dockerfile that runs only `scripts/03-zlib.sh`, `scripts/04-fftw3.sh` and
`scripts/48-whisper.sh` against `nomercyentertainment/ffmpeg-base:latest`,
stopping before FFmpeg's own build so the configured source tree survives).

- **`HAS_GGUF_H` = yes.** `${PREFIX}/include/gguf.h` is installed by whisper's
  cmake install step, and `gguf_init_from_file()` compiles, links and runs
  (verified against a nonexistent path, which correctly returns an error
  rather than crashing). The GGUF reader is available — the plan proceeds
  with real GGUF, not the flat-container fallback.
  - Note for implementers: linking any translation unit that calls into
    `gguf_init_from_file` pulls in `ggml-quants.c`'s OpenMP-parallelized
    quantization initializers (`iq2xs_init_impl`, `iq3xs_init_impl`), which
    need `-fopenmp` (glibc: `-lgomp`) on the link line or you get spurious
    `undefined reference to GOMP_*` errors that look like "gguf.h is
    unusable" but are not. This is the same root cause as FFmpeg's own
    `./configure` needing `--pkg-config-flags=--static` to pick up
    `whisper.pc`'s `Libs.private: -lstdc++ -lm -fopenmp`
    (`scripts/48-whisper.sh:158-186`) — without it, FFmpeg's whisper
    pkg-config link-test fails the same way and configure misreports
    "whisper >= 1.7.5 not found".
- **`HAS_CONV2D_DIRECT` = yes, and it is what ships.** `ggml_conv_2d_direct(ctx,
  a, b, s0, s1, p0, p1, d0, d1)` is declared in `ggml.h` and links cleanly with
  F32 kernels (kernel `a` is `[KW, KH, IC, OC]`, input `b` is `[W, H, C, N]`).

  When this was first probed, the plan of record was F16 kernels with
  `ggml_conv_2d`, and this op was recorded as an escape hatch to be used only if
  parity failed because of F16 precision loss. **Parity did fail — 0 of 12
  encoder layers at `rtol=1e-3` — and the escape hatch was taken.** The cause was
  not the stored weights: `ggml_conv_2d` builds its im2col buffer in F16, so it
  rounds *activations* as well, which is a property of the op and not of our
  artifact. With `ggml_conv_2d_direct` and a runtime cast the same graph reaches
  12/12, and the decoder's `ggml_conv_transpose_2d_p0` turns out to accept an F32
  kernel by the same route.

  **The artifact did not change.** The cast is a graph node, not an on-disk
  format: `spleeter-2stems-f16.gguf` is still fp16 and still 39,319,552 bytes.
  That is the point a future reader most needs, because the original reasoning
  for avoiding this op assumed the switch would double the download.

  It is also faster and smaller: the F32 direct path measured 11% quicker and
  5 MiB lighter than the F16 im2col path it replaced, which skips a ~26 MiB
  im2col buffer. There was never a speed argument for the old path.

- **`ggml_pad_ext` (probed) = exists.** Signature:
  `ggml_pad_ext(ctx, a, lp0, rp0, lp1, rp1, lp2, rp2, lp3, rp3)` — zero-pads
  each of the 4 dimensions independently on the left and right. This is a
  native per-side padding op, unlike `ggml_pad`/`ggml_pad_circular`
  (symmetric-only, `p0..p3`). It directly expresses the asymmetric
  TensorFlow `SAME` padding (1 before, 2 after) that section 6.3's `Conv2D
  5x5 s2 SAME` row currently emulates by hand via a zeroed intermediate
  tensor — a later task may use it to simplify that emulation, but this task
  makes no implementation change; it only confirms the op is available.

#### 6.3.2 GGUF stores conv kernels axis-reversed from what ggml's conv ops need

Found during Task 7; recorded because no upstream document states it and the
symptom is a plausible-looking wrong answer rather than an error.

The converter builds each kernel as a numpy array shaped `(kw, kh, ic, oc)` and
hands it to `GGUFWriter`, which writes numpy shapes **reversed** into ggml's `ne`.
The stored tensor therefore arrives as `ne = [oc, ic, kh, kw]`. But `ggml_conv_2d`
expects `ne = [KW, KH, IC, OC]` — the exact reverse.

The loader adapts once, at load time, via `ss_repack_kernel`, applied uniformly to
all 26 conv kernels so the compute graph sees a consistent model.

This is deliberately fixed in the loader rather than the converter. Adapting
storage layout to compute layout on load is the ordinary ggml-loader pattern; it
costs a single pass over roughly 20 MB, once. Moving it into the converter would
change the on-disk layout and ripple into both the converter's verified
100-tensor contract and the loader's shape validation, for no runtime gain.

### 6.4 Unit 4 — build integration (`scripts/60-stemsplit.sh`)

Follows `scripts/57-keydetect.sh` verbatim in structure:

1. Copy `af_stemsplit.c` into `libavfilter/`.
2. `sed` the `extern const FFFilter ff_af_stemsplit;` declaration into
   `allfilters.c` after the last audio filter extern.
3. `sed` `OBJS-$(CONFIG_STEMSPLIT_FILTER) += af_stemsplit.o` into the Makefile.
4. Insert `stemsplit_filter_deps="whisper"` into `configure`.

Each step verifies itself and exits non-zero on failure, matching the existing
scripts. `--enable-filter=all` picks the filter up; no `add_enable` call is needed.

---

## 7. High-band extension — where we improve on upstream

`2stems.json` sets `"mask_extension": "zeros"`. Every bin above **11 025 Hz is
zeroed in every stem**. This is the origin of Spleeter's characteristic muffled
output, and it means the stems do not sum back to the mixture.

The `highband` option selects the behaviour:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `passthrough` | **default.** The untouched high band of the mixture is routed into exactly one stem and zeroed in all others. The receiving stem is the **last entry in the model's instrument list**, which for `2stems` is `accompaniment`. Cymbals and air survive in a karaoke track. |
| `zeros` | bit-compatible with upstream Spleeter. Used by the parity tests. |
| `average` | Spleeter's other documented mode: the mask's mean over the modelled bins is tiled across the high band. |

Defaulting to `passthrough` means the out-of-box result sounds better than the
Python tool; `highband=zeros` remains available for anyone comparing against it.

---

## 8. Filter interface

```bash
# karaoke: instrumental only
ffmpeg -i song.flac -af "stemsplit=model=2stems.gguf:stem=accompaniment" karaoke.flac

# both stems
ffmpeg -i song.flac -filter_complex \
  "[0:a]stemsplit=model=2stems.gguf:stem=all[v][a]" \
  -map "[v]" vocals.flac -map "[a]" music.flac
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | *required* | path to the `.gguf` model |
| `stem` | enum | `all` | `vocals`, `accompaniment`, or `all` |
| `highband` | enum | `passthrough` | `passthrough`, `zeros`, or `average` |
| `overlap` | duration | `0` | crossfade between segments |
| `threads` | int | `0` | ggml CPU threads; 0 means the filter default |
| `dump` | string | `""` | **internal.** Directory to write per-layer tensors to, for the parity tests of section 9.2. Not documented in the README. |

`stem=all` uses `AVFILTER_FLAG_DYNAMIC_OUTPUTS`, appending output pads in `init()`
via `ff_append_outpad` — the `af_channelsplit` pattern. `stem=<name>` produces a
single output, which matters because the ffmpeg CLI treats an unconnected filter
output as an error; the single-stem form is what makes the common case usable with
plain `-af`.

`overlap` defaults to `0` for reference parity. Spleeter processes 11.9 s chunks
with no overlap and has audible seams; a non-zero value processes overlapping
segments and crossfades the output, at proportional cost.

---

## 9. Testing

### 9.1 STFT round-trip
Analysis followed by synthesis with no mask applied must reconstruct the input to
better than -90 dB. Catches window, hop, scaling and lead-in/crop errors before
any machine learning is involved.

### 9.2 Per-layer parity
For the fixed reference segment emitted by the converter, compare all 13 layer
outputs per network against the Python reference at `rtol=1e-3`. This is the
safety net for the padding-crop arithmetic in section 6.3 and must pass before any
subjective listening.

**The reference must be generated at the shipped precision.** The Python
reference rounds each convolution kernel through float16 and back
(`kernel.astype(np.float16).astype(np.float32)`) before loading it into Keras,
mirroring what the converter writes. Biases and BatchNorm affine terms are F32 in
the artifact and stay F32 in the reference.

This coupling is load-bearing and was learned the hard way. A reference built from
the full-precision checkpoint disagrees with the shipped fp16 model by 1e-3 to
9e-3 relative — enough to fail every layer at `rtol=1e-3` while the graph itself
is exactly correct. Generated at matching precision, the same graph agrees to
1.6e-5 at `conv1` and 1.1e-4 at `conv6`.

The consequence: **if the artifact's precision ever changes, these fixtures must be
regenerated.** Testing against weights the runtime never sees measures a
deliberate precision choice rather than a correctness difference, and the whole
value of this gate is that it measures only the latter.

### 9.3 End-to-end separation
A synthetic mix — low sine (bass), band-limited noise (percussion), and a
vocal-band tone — with assertions on where energy lands. Deterministic, needs no
reference audio committed to the repo, and catches gross routing errors.

### 9.4 Smoke
`ffmpeg -filters | grep stemsplit` added to `tests/tests.sh` and `tests/tests.ps1`,
matching the coverage the other custom filters already have.

### 9.5 Dev harness
`dev/ffstem-vol`, mirroring the existing ffkey-vol / ffhls-vol harnesses: a
volume-mounted Docker image that rebuilds only the filter and reruns the tests, so
the padding work does not require a full cross-compile per iteration.

No large binaries enter git. Parity fixtures are per-layer checksums plus small
slices, not full tensors.

## 10. Error handling

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `model` not given | `AVERROR(EINVAL)` naming the `model` option |
| model file missing or unreadable | `AVERROR(EIO)` with the path and the release-asset URL |
| GGUF architecture tag unrecognised | `AVERROR(EINVAL)`, refuse to guess |
| GGUF tensor shape mismatch | `AVERROR(EINVAL)` naming the offending tensor |
| `stem` names a stem absent from the model | `AVERROR(EINVAL)` listing available stems |
| allocation failure | `AVERROR(ENOMEM)` |

ggml log output is bridged to `av_log` at matching severity, as `af_whisper.c`
does with `cb_log`.

## 11. Licensing and distribution

- Spleeter's code and released model checkpoints come from an MIT-licensed
  repository. The JOSS citation (Hennequin et al., 2020) is recorded in the
  converter's README and in the repo README's custom-features table.
- Upstream's own advisory is carried forward in documentation: users must hold
  the necessary rights to any copyrighted material they process.
- The model is a GitHub release asset on this repo, downloaded by the user or by
  the media server the same way whisper's ggml models are. Platform tarballs do
  not grow.

---

## 12. Documentation

- `README.md`: add `stemsplit` to the custom-features table alongside `keydetect`
  and `beatdetect`, with the two example command lines and the model download link.
- `tools/spleeter-gguf/README.md`: how to regenerate the model and the fixtures.

## 13. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Asymmetric SAME padding implemented wrong | **high** — output sounds plausible but is incorrect | per-layer parity tests (9.2) gate all other work |
| `gguf.h` not installed by whisper.cpp | ~~medium~~ **resolved** — `HAS_GGUF_H = yes`, probed 2026-08-19 (6.3.1) | n/a — real GGUF confirmed available, flat-container fallback not needed |
| `ggml_conv_2d` F16 kernel constraint | ~~low~~ **resolved** — probed 2026-08-19, and the risk materialised (6.3.1) | The F16 im2col path failed parity 0/12 by rounding activations. The graph uses `ggml_conv_2d_direct` with a runtime F32 cast; the stored artifact is unchanged at fp16, and the new path is also faster and smaller (see 6.3.1) |
| 11.9 s latency surprises a caller | low | documented as offline-only |
| Quality below expectations for some material | medium | Spleeter's known ceiling; `highband=passthrough` recovers part of it; model is swappable |
| freebsd / windows-aarch64 lack BLAS | low | ggml's own kernels are used, as they already are for whisper on those targets |
